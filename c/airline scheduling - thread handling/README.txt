Program ACS (Airline Check-in System) is able to take in an input file of customer data and use threading to simulate the handling of each customer being services.

How to use ACS
Step 1: compile test files that you want to use
Step 2: execute "make" in terminal to compile ACS
Step 3: execute "./ACS inputfile0.txt" in terminal to run ACS on inputfile0.txt (or any other input file in same dir)

Important notes for ACS:
1) error handling does not exist for CMD errors - ensure usage is correct
2) ignore warnings after running the makefile
